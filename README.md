## Version support

| Minecraft Version | Status       |
|-------------------|--------------|
| 1.21.4            | âœ… Current    |

I try to keep support up for the latest major and latest minor release of Minecraft. Updates to newer Minecraft
versions may be delayed from time to time, as I do not always have the time to immediately update my mods.

Unsupported versions are still available to download, but they won't receive new features or bugfixes.

## Usage

The Fabric API is required. This mod is not required on clients when playing on multiplayer.

This mod adds 2 new commands to the `/scoreboard` command:

- `/scoreboard objectives update <objective>`
- `/scoreboard players update <player>`

The first can be used to update an objective with a statistic criterion. The second can be used to update a player's score
for all existing objectives with a statistic criterion.
